        <h1>Chemical Engineering</h1>
        <p>Department of Chemical Engineering was the birth place for some other academic disciplines in this university. Department of Biotechnology and Department of Nuclear Technology were founded as sub-divisions under the Department of Chemical Engineering, and later they have been standing as separate Departments under the Ministry of Science and Technology. In 2012, the Department of Chemical Engineering was reopened the undergraduate courses for excellent students who have passed Matriculation. Also reopened was the Post Graduate Diploma course in Food Technology, which had been closed for some years since 2006. Therefore, Department of Chemical Engineering is in great momentum in producing qualified engineers who will be of great service to our homeland.</p>
        <br><h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>To provide a supportive environment for quality education; to prepare graduates for career opportunities by fostering the development of professionalism, leadership skills and ethical behaviour; to contribute to expanding the knowledge in chemical engineering and its related fields.</p>
        <br><h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>The Department of Chemical Engineering will be intended to a highly-prestigious engineering department both in teaching and in research with a strong commitment to systematically educate and fortify chemical engineering graduates for professional practices and life-long learning.</p>
        <br><h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>It was founded in 1954 at B.O.C, with classes taught by Indian visiting lecturers. U Khin Aung Kyi, a graduate from M.I.T. with S.B. and S.M. degrees from M.I.T, became head of department in 1958. The Department of Chemical Engineering was moved from B.O.C. to the campus of RIT in 1961.</p>
